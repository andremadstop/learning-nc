# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-26)

**Core value:** Effektives Lernen mit Spaced Repetition in einer vertrauten Nextcloud-Umgebung.
**Current focus:** v5.0.0 Certification-as-a-Service — Phase 154: Pass-Definition

## Current Position

Phase: 154 of 157 (Pass-Definition)
Plan: 02 of 5 (next — 154-01 complete)
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-06-26 — Plan 154-01 complete: PassResult DTO + PassCriteriaService skeleton + 11 skipped PHPUnit stubs.

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 20% (1/5 plans in Phase 154)

## Performance Metrics

- Granularity: standard
- Parallelization: on (Phases 156+157 run parallel after 155)
- v4.4.0 shipped: 5 phases (149-153), 30 plans — App Store live 2026-04-27

| Phase | Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|-------|------|----------|-------|-------|
| 154 Pass-Definition | P01 | ~15min | 2 | 4 |

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions (v5.0.0)

- [Roadmap] Phase 154 first — lucky-guess exclusion + FSRS-vs-pass separation locked before any crypto work
- [Roadmap] Phase 155 entry gate — signing-format ADR (VC-JWT vs eddsa-jcs-2022) recorded as FIRST task; no signing code before ADR is decided
- [Roadmap] Issuer = did:web of the NC instance; NO multi-tenant platform; wallet interop deferred to v6+
- [Roadmap] Key rotation (oc_learning_cert_keys) IS in scope for Phase 155 — owner decision; rotation must not invalidate past certs
- [Roadmap] Phases 156+157 run parallel after Phase 155 closes (config.parallelization=true)

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions for full table and prior milestone decisions.

### Critical Pitfalls (carry into Phase 155)

- PITFALL 1: Signing wrong bytes (canonicalization) — ADR resolves this as first task of Phase 155
- PITFALL 2: Private key in wrong location — ICrypto::encrypt() only; never AppConfig plaintext; never in exports/snapshots/app package

### Blockers/Concerns

- TOOLING: `gsd-tools state update-progress` / `record-session` corrupted STATE.md frontmatter during 154-01 execution (overwrote milestone v5.0.0 → v2.3, lost current_phase/plan, wrong phase totals). Restored manually. Avoid `state advance-plan`/`update-progress` on this STATE.md until the parser handles the v5.0.0 frontmatter shape.

### Execution Notes (154-01)

- Skeleton constructor uses plain params + scoped `@phpstan-ignore-next-line`: PHPStan L5 rejects both unused promoted readonly properties and unused plain params; deps go unused until 154-03 replaces the body.
